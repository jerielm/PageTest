  <p>I'm really into food. I was a professional cook for about 4 years so I know my way
    around a kitchen. Couldn't get the nagging feeling of wanting to visualize data on an
    everyday level. Things like how many ingredients were used throughout the day,
    how much food is wasted for products and what what selling vs not selling. 
    I probably could've had someone else think about it for me but to be honest it wasn't
    only restaurant related things.

  </p>
  <p>Big fan of hikes and again good food. Nothing makes me happier than a view followed by 
    lunch/dinner. I used to take my dogs out for hikes but they're getting older now so I can only
    take them out for walks.
